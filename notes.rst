Warning: this is a talk about making slides for talks, and it will have
demonstrations. So it's bound to be messy, and may go wrong!

What we shall cover
===================

...

Why make slides from a markup language?
=======================================

...


Why *not* make slides from a markup language?
=============================================

...

Why reStructuredText?
=====================

...

Special note: Jupyter Notebooks
===============================

Doesn't really belong in this talk, because it uses markdown rather than
reStructuredText, but I'm going to mention it briefly anyway beause it's so
useful to be able to make slides out of a Jupyter notebook, and it's very easy.

Tools and examples
==================

Things to talk about for each:

* what makes it interesting
* what "special" things it can do
* what format are slides (HTML, HTML and Javascript, PDF, etc.)
* how slide notes are represented (if at all)
* how code is represented (if at all), and does it use ``pygments``
* is it direct from reStructuredText to the slides, or does it go via an
  intermediate step, and does that mean installing More Stuff (I'm looking at
  TeX and LaTeX here!)
* have I used it for a talk, and if so which one(s)? (and can I still use that
  as an example?)
